## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - `requests` 🌐: For sending HTTP requests to fetch web content.  
  - `BeautifulSoup` (`bs4`) 🥣: To parse and extract HTML elements.  
  - `pandas` 🗃️: For data manipulation and organization.  
  - `matplotlib.pyplot` 📊: For data visualization.  
  - `time` ⏳: To manage request delays and ensure smooth execution.  
  - `IPython.display` 📺: For enhanced data visualization in notebooks.
